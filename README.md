# Countdown Timer Project ‚è≤Ô∏è

This simple web-based countdown timer project was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's one of my first projects, aimed at helping me learn the basics of web development.


## Features

The countdown timer will display the remaining time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
When the countdown reaches zero, it can trigger a customizable action (e.g., display a message or play a sound).


## Usage/Examples

-Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

-Open the index.html file in your web browser.

-The countdown timer will start and display the remaining time.
